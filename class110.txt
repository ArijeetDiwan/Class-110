draw a destribution for a temperture in a room 
draw random sample from the population to create a sampling
find the population mean , standard deviation 
find the sampling mean , standard devation 
find the relation between the sampling mean and population mean 
find the relation between sampling standard deviation and population standard deviation  
output:
population mean  3.933977711872023
population standard deviation   0.350970118315556
sampling mean 3.9332972
sampling standard deviation  0.035254893272560886
